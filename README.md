## Simulations for CODAP

A while ago, when I was teaching a high school 'mathematics of data management' course, I made a lab book that included some Fathom simulations that students would interact with, extend, and answer questions about. 

Over the next little while, I am going to try porting some of those over to (CODAP)[https://concord.org/projects/codap].
